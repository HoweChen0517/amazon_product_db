# amazon_product_db

This is the project repo for ntu sd6103 data systems course individual assignment.

In this project, my goal is to build a Amazon e-commerce database which include data about products, categories and reviews, etc.

From this database, we can derieve insights into

1. Descriptive/Predictive task
2. Social Network Analysis
3. Data Visualization
4. EDA
5. ....

Technically, I intend to use the Databricks database because it provides notebooks for writing scripts based on languages ​​such as Python, SQL, R, Scala, etc., which allows me to better carry out ETL work.
